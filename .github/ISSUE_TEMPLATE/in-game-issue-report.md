> üí° Most in-game issues are **game-specific** and not directly related to **XXMI Launcher** or the **XXMI DLL**. Such reports **will not be accepted here** and should be routed to Model Importer repositories instead. Model Importers are being maintained by different devs and they won't check this thread.

## üß© Before You Report an Issue

If the issue only happens when using certain mods, please **check the following first**:

- ‚úÖ Make sure the mods are **up to date**.
- üïí If the mod page hasn't been updated since the **last game update**, the mod may be **incompatible**.
- üîß For such mods you usually can find **mod fixing tools and guides** provided by the community.
- üë§ Try reaching out to the **mod author** for support.
- üí¨ You can also ask for help in the [AGMG Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg/agmg).

> ‚ùó Only continue with this issue report if you‚Äôve exhausted these steps and have **good reason to believe the problem is related to the Model Importer** itself.
